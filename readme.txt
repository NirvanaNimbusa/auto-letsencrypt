Automatically add new domains to existing SSL Certificate of main domain

== Description ==

Automatically adds or removes domains from existing SSL Certificate generated by certbot.

This plugin requires that the user running PHP-FPM can run function `exec` and has `sudo` access to following commands:
`service nginx reload
certbot
nginx -t
`

To add these commands to be sudoed you can create a file named `/etc/sudoers.d/auto-letsencrypt` with the following content:
`someuser ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/service nginx reload
someuser ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/certbot
someuser ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nginx -t
`
Replace `someuser` with the actual username of the user running PHP-FPM.

== Installation ==
1. Add the plugin's folder in the WordPress' plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin.
